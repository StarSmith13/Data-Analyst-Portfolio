## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Vedant! Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. My passion lies in Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing, and uncovering meaningful insights from both structured and unstructured data. With a strong foundation in Python and SQL, I thrive on exploring patterns and trends that drive impactful decisions.

During the past few academic years, I got the opportunity to gain theoretical and practical knowledge on technologies such as Data Mining, Data Management, Statistical Analysis, etc. I am excited to bring my analytical acumen to prospective work opportunities.

In addition, I like exploring Data Visualization and Data Collection tools like Power BI and Microsoft Excel and in my free time I focus on my soft skills such as interpersonal communication, developing leadership calibre and honing presentation and public speaking skills.
