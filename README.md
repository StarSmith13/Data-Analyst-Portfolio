## Portfolio Projects
### Movie Recommendation System
**Objective:** To accurately recommend top 5 similar films based on the user's latest viewing from the top 70 movie dataset.\
**Code:** [https://github.com/StarSmith13/Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb](https://github.com/StarSmith13/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/MovieRecommender.ipynb)\
**Description:** I rendered the movie dataset using Gen Ai. It has columns such as, *Director*, *Lead cast*, *Plot* and *Genre*. These columns are preprocessed and feature is extracted for all the records. Based on these, I have mapped a Tfidf matrix and a consine similarity matrix. Recommendations are made on these values. 

**Result:** Top 5 most similar films are recommended based on the similarity in features and aspects of the films.

**Skills:** stopwords removal & tokenization, feature extraction, count vectorization, gen ai

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Sklearn
